# My Homelab Journey

The first steps on my Homelab journey were taken somewhere around 2018/2019. Back then I tried to setup a Nextcloud with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and expose it to the internet, so that I could access it from anywhere. I setup Nextcloud and a DynDNS service and was able to achieve the initial goal. Unfortunately I did not take the time to correctly configure Nextcloud. It was slow and errors occurred frequently. So I abandoned the project.

Around 2020/2021 I started developing my own accounting/invoicing app. When I tried to deploy it on the Pi 3, I realized that installing Node.js modules on it, is an absolute pain because it takes forever. So I shorthandedly bought a Pi 5.
